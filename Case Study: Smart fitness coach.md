# Case Study: Smart fitness coach

## Personas

###### Raquel

Raquel is 40 years old and she is the CEO of a company. She is looking to lose weight and get healthier in the pandemic. However Raquel doesn’t have a lot of time and can’t go to the gym because of lockdown. She also doesn’t know a lot about fitness and exercise so she needs help planning her workouts and performing the exercises. She would use our app to have an accessible way to do exercise with the support of a smart fitness coach that would guide her through the exercises and correct her technique. 

**Needs:** 

- She needs to be able to do her exercise from home in an accessible way 
- She needs to be able to set her weight goal 
- She needs to be able to calculate her macros to lose weight 
- She needs a categorized list of workouts that are suited for her age, level of physical activity and schedule 
- She needs instructions on how to perform the exercises 
- She needs real-time auditive feedback on how to improve her performance 

###### Remígio

Remígio (20 years old) is a college student with some experience in muscle hipertrophy. He wants to progress in building muscle but he cannot afford a gym subscription. Building muscle can be dangerous especially without an attentive fitness coach and Remigio knows the risk of injuries because he already suffered with them. Remigio is a fitness enthusiast so he doesn’t mind spending a good amount of time working out so he wants a full analysis of his exercise performance. He would use our app to have a real time analysis (with feedback) of his performance.

**Needs:** 

- Categorized catalog of workouts targeting specific body parts 
- Real-time analysis of exercise performance
- Increased volume and difficulty in the exercises along the time 
- Receive post-set analysis of good, medium and bad repetitions with tips to improve technique, maximize hipertrophy and avoid injury 
- Observe form progress and proximity to goals
